Frontend tidy notes:
- index.html now only shows Game Weeks with a nav link to /recommendations.
- recommendations.html includes expanded tabs (1H/2H, team goals/corners) and summary cards with reconciliation metrics and confidence bands.
- app.js simplified to only initialize GameWeekManager and theme.
- Consider removing unused enhanced.html if not needed.
